This Readme is here to tell about the code and how it works

Code:

This is a code sample for a basic Student or Teacher Registration app, designed to save data on a MongoDB server for record purposes. Every time a student or teacher is registered, their data is saved in MongoDB.

Working:

Save these files and open VS Code. Install the packages mentioned in the `package.json` file. In the terminal, run `npm install`. (Note: Use the names of all required packages with spaces in between.) Then, in the terminal, run either `node app.js` or `nodemon app.js` (preferred). You will see a link because the server is running on http://localhost:3000. Press Ctrl and click on the link. You will be redirected to a web page with the URL localhost:3000. Navigate to localhost:3000/register to access the registration form. Once you save your data, it will be displayed in your MongoDB.

MongoDB:

Set up MongoDB and create a new connection with any name you like, and connect again, save data in the  registration form, and your data will be displayed under MYDATA_db in the users in the MongoDB sidebar on the left side.
